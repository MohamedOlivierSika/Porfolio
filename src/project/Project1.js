        <p>I developed the frontend of a flight booking web application using 
           React to deliver a smooth and dynamic user experience. The project
           involved  and implementing a responsive user interface, allowing users
           to easily input personal details and select seats for booking. I integrated
           RESTful APIs to fetch available flight and seat data in real-time from the backend,
           ensuring users always had up-to-date information.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        I designed and implemented a responsive e-commerce platform using React and Redux, ensuring a seamless and optimized user experience with a scalable architecture. The platform's interactive home page features a dynamic product carousel, which pulls data directly from a MongoDB database through a Node.js backend API. To enhance performance, I applied lazy loading and code-splitting techniques, reducing load times and improving the overall efficiency of the application.
